The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl- transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel. As part of the 5S RNP/5S ribonucleoprotein particle it is an essential component of the LSU, required for its formation and the maturation of rRNAs. It also couples ribosome biogenesis to p53/TP53 activation. As part of the 5S RNP it accumulates in the nucleoplasm and inhibits MDM2, when ribosome biogenesis is perturbed, mediating the stabilization and the activation of TP53.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MAAAAAQGGGGGEPRRTEGVGPGVPGEVEMVKGQPFDVGPRYTQLQYIGEGAYGMVSSAYDHVRKTRVAIKKISPFEHQTYCQRTLREIQILLRFRHENVIGIRDILRASTLEAMRDVYIVQDLMETDLYKLLKSQQLSNDHICYFLYQILRGLKYIHSANVLHRDLKPSNLLINTTCDLKICDFGLARIADPEHDHTGFLTEYVATRWYRAPEIMLNSKGYTKSIDIWSVGCILAEMLSNRPIFPGKHYLDQLNHILGILGSPSQEDLNCIINMKARNYLQSLPSKTKVAWAKLFPKSDSKALDLLDRMLTFNPNKRITVEEALAHPYLEQYYDPTDEPVAEEPFTFAMELDDLPKERLKELIFQETARFQPGVLEAP","Homo sapiens","2ZOQ|4QTB|6GES","Tchem","Kinase","3.205716","3.296444","2.597365","3.162503","3.917726","2.665503","3.59387","3.426534","3.422587","3.141159","3.503672","3.579891","4.672361","3.019254","2.630114","3.319205","3.201796","3.218123","3.071875","2.425797"

Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa- B RelB-p52 complexes. In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Participates also in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities. Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at 'Ser-10' that are subsequently acetylated at 'Lys-14' by CREBBP. Additionally, phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MERPPGLRPGAGGPWEMRERLGTGGFGNVCLYQHRELDLKIAIKSCRLELSTKNRERWCHEIQIMKKLNHANVVKACDVPEELNILIHDVPLLAMEYCSGGDLRKLLNKPENCCGLKESQILSLLSDIGSGIRYLHENKIIHRDLKPENIVLQDVGGKIIHKIIDLGYAKDVDQGSLCTSFVGTLQYLAPELFENKPYTATVDYWSFGTMVFECIAGYRPFLHHLQPFTWHEKIKKKDPKCIFACEEMSGEVRFSSHLPQPNSLCSLVVEPMENWLQLMLNWDPQQRGGPVDLTLKQPRCFVLMDHILNLKIVHILNMTSAKIISFLLPPDESLHSLQSRIERETGINTGSQELLSETGISLDPRKPASQCVLDGVRGCDSYMVYLFDKSKTVYEGPFASRSLSDCVNYIVQDSKIQLPIIQLRKVWAEAVHYVSGLKEDYSRLFQGQRAAMLSLLRYNANLTKMKNTLISASQQLKAKLEFFHKSIQLDLERYSEQMTYGISSEKMLKAWKEMEEKAIHYAEVGVIGYLEDQIMSLHAEIMELQKSPYGRRQGDLMESLEQRAIDLYKQLKHRPSDHSYSDSTEMVKIIVHTVQSQDRVLKELFGHLSKLLGCKQKIIDLLPKVEVALSNIKEADNTVMFMQGKRQKEIWHLLKIACTQSSARSLVGSSLEGAVTPQTSAWLPPTSAEHDHSLSCVVTPQDGETSAQMIEENLNCLGHLSTIIHEANEEQGNSMMNLDWSWLTE","Homo sapiens","3BRT|5EBZ|5TQW|5TQX|5TQY","Tchem","Kinase","1.855982","4.574197","1.941558","2.626676","1.823992","0.869232","4.528841","2.870713","2.81569","2.901152","2.604056","2.477627","2.78624","2.084867","1.575509","2.509753","2.868078","2.225264","1.968203","1.061111"

ISGylation involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving E1, E2, and E3 enzymes which catalyze the conjugation of ISG15 to a lysine residue in the target protein. Its target proteins include IFIT1, MX1/MxA, PPM1B, UBE2L6, UBA7, CHMP5, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and CHMP6. Can also isgylate: EIF2AK2/PKR which results in its activation, DDX58/RIG-I which inhibits its function in antiviral signaling response, EIF4E2 which enhances its cap structure-binding activity and translation- inhibition activity, UBE2N and UBE2E1 which negatively regulates their activity, IRF3 which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation and FLNB which prevents its ability to interact with the upstream activators of the JNK cascade therby inhibiting IFNA- induced JNK signaling. Exhibits antiviral activity towards both DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A, HIV-1 and Ebola virus. Restricts HIV-1 and ebola virus via disruption of viral budding. Inhibits the ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and host TSG101 and disrupts their interaction, thereby preventing assembly and release of virions from infected cells. Inhibits Ebola virus budding mediated by the VP40 protein by disrupting ubiquitin ligase activity of NEDD4 and its ability to ubiquitinate VP40. ISGylates influenza A virus NS1 protein which causes a loss of function of the protein and the inhibition of virus replication.

MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade plays also a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade. Mediates phosphorylation of TPR in respons to EGF stimulation. May play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint. Phosphorylates PML and promotes its interaction with PIN1, leading to PML degradation. Phosphorylates CDK2AP2 (By similarity).","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MAAAAAAGAGPEMVRGQVFDVGPRYTNLSYIGEGAYGMVCSAYDNVNKVRVAIKKISPFEHQTYCQRTLREIKILLRFRHENIIGINDIIRAPTIEQMKDVYIVQDLMETDLYKLLKTQHLSNDHICYFLYQILRGLKYIHSANVLHRDLKPSNLLLNTTCDLKICDFGLARVADPDHDHTGFLTEYVATRWYRAPEIMLNSKGYTKSIDIWSVGCILAEMLSNRPIFPGKHYLDQLNHILGILGSPSQEDLNCIINLKARNYLLSLPHKNKVPWNRLFPNADSKALDLLDKMLTFNPHKRIEVEQALAHPYLEQYYDPSDEPIAEAPFKFDMELDDLPKEKLKELIFEETARFQPGYRS","Homo sapiens","1PME|1TVO|1WZY|2OJG|2OJI|2OJJ|2Y9Q|3D42|3D44|3I5Z|3I60|3SA0|3TEI|3W55|4FMQ|4FUX|4FUY|4FV0|4FV1|4FV2|4FV3|4FV4|4FV5|4FV6|4FV7|4FV8|4FV9|4G6N|4G6O|4H3P|4H3Q|4IZ5|4IZ7|4IZA|4N0S|4NIF|4O6E|4QP1|4QP2|4QP3|4QP4|4QP6|4QP7|4QP8|4QP9|4QPA|4QTA|4QTE|4XJ0|4ZXT|4ZZM|4ZZN|4ZZO|5AX3|5BUE|5BUI|5BUJ|5BVD|5BVE|5BVF|5K4I|5LCJ|5LCK|5NGU|5NHF|5NHH|5NHJ|5NHL|5NHO|5NHP|5NHV|5V60|5V61|5V62|5WP1|6D5Y|6DMG|6G54|6G8X|6G91|6G92|6G93|6G97|6G9A|6G9D|6G9H|6G9J|6G9K|6G9M|6G9N|6GDM|6GDQ|6GE0|6GJB|6GJD|6Q7K|6QAG|6QAL|6QAQ|6QAW","Tchem","Kinase","2.652373","4.573195","2.182185","2.579206","3.004404","1.80678","3.039272","3.102898","3.082478","4.586139","4.627952","2.988374","4.92638","2.612766","1.924827","3.337889","2.893735","2.608844","2.571072","1.880264"

Exerts its antiviral activity on a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus (MV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1). Inhibits viral replication via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2S1), this phosphorylation impairs the recycling of EIF2S1 between successive rounds of initiation leading to inhibition of translation which eventually results in shutdown of cellular and viral protein synthesis. Also phosphorylates other substrates including p53/TP53, PPP2R5A, DHX9, ILF3, IRS1 and the HHV-1 viral protein US11. In addition to serine/threonine-protein kinase activity, also has tyrosine-protein kinase activity and phosphorylates CDK1 at 'Tyr-4' upon DNA damage, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Either as an adapter protein and/or via its kinase activity, can regulate various signaling pathways (p38 MAP kinase, NF-kappa-B and insulin signaling pathways) and transcription factors (JUN, STAT1, STAT3, IRF1, ATF3) involved in the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and IFNs. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via interaction with IKBKB and TRAF family of proteins and activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway via interaction with MAP2K6. Can act as both a positive and negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway (ISP). Negatively regulates ISP by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at 'Ser- 312' and positively regulates ISP via phosphorylation of PPP2R5A which activates FOXO1, which in turn up-regulates the expression of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2). Can regulate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes. Can trigger apoptosis via FADD-mediated activation of CASP8. Plays a role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton by binding to gelsolin (GSN), sequestering the protein in an inactive conformation away from actin.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MAGDLSAGFFMEELNTYRQKQGVVLKYQELPNSGPPHDRRFTFQVIIDGREFPEGEGRSKKEAKNAAAKLAVEILNKEKKAVSPLLLTTTNSSEGLSMGNYIGLINRIAQKKRLTVNYEQCASGVHGPEGFHYKCKMGQKEYSIGTGSTKQEAKQLAAKLAYLQILSEETSVKSDYLSSGSFATTCESQSNSLVTSTLASESSSEGDFSADTSEINSNSDSLNSSSLLMNGLRNNQRKAKRSLAPRFDLPDMKETKYTVDKRFGMDFKEIELIGSGGFGQVFKAKHRIDGKTYVIKRVKYNNEKAEREVKALAKLDHVNIVHYNGCWDGFDYDPETSDDSLESSDYDPENSKNSSRSKTKCLFIQMEFCDKGTLEQWIEKRRGEKLDKVLALELFEQITKGVDYIHSKKLIHRDLKPSNIFLVDTKQVKIGDFGLVTSLKNDGKRTRSKGTLRYMSPEQISSQDYGKEVDLYALGLILAELLHVCDTAFETSKFFTDLRDGIISDIFDKKEKTLLQKLLSKKPEDRPNTSEILRTLTVWKKSPEKNERHTC","Homo sapiens","1QU6|2A19|2A1A|3UIU","Tchem","Kinase","1.409086","2.293095","0.966927","2.063633","1.549322","0.966924","2.291259","1.902264","2.3948","4.473028","2.262438","2.182494","4.501246","1.862494","1.503746","1.56066","2.546283","1.416847","1.635026","0.973128"

Extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK9/JNK2. In turn, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. In response to oxidative or ribotoxic stresses, inhibits rRNA synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the RNA polymerase 1-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3. Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including TP53 and YAP1. In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, is activated by CARMA1, BCL10, MAP2K7 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to regulate JUN protein levels. Plays an important role in the osmotic stress-induced epithelial tight-junctions disruption. When activated, promotes beta-catenin/CTNNB1 degradation and inhibits the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS- RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules. May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade. Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling. Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin.

Extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK8/JNK1. In turn, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN, JDP2 and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, inhibiting the interaction between CDT1 and the histone H4 acetylase HBO1 to replication origins. Loss of this interaction abrogates the acetylation required for replication initiation. Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including p53/TP53 and Yes-associates protein YAP1. In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Contributes to the survival of erythroid cells by phosphorylating the antagonist of cell death BAD upon EPO stimulation. Mediates starvation-induced BCL2 phosphorylation, BCL2 dissociation from BECN1, and thus activation of autophagy. Phosphorylates STMN2 and hence regulates microtubule dynamics, controlling neurite elongation in cortical neurons. In the developing brain, through its cytoplasmic activity on STMN2, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and of radial migration from the ventricular zone. Phosphorylates several other substrates including heat shock factor protein 4 (HSF4), the deacetylase SIRT1, ELK1, or the E3 ligase ITCH. Phosphorylates the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock. Phosphorylates the heat shock transcription factor HSF1, suppressing HSF1-induced transcriptional activity.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MSRSKRDNNFYSVEIGDSTFTVLKRYQNLKPIGSGAQGIVCAAYDAILERNVAIKKLSRPFQNQTHAKRAYRELVLMKCVNHKNIIGLLNVFTPQKSLEEFQDVYIVMELMDANLCQVIQMELDHERMSYLLYQMLCGIKHLHSAGIIHRDLKPSNIVVKSDCTLKILDFGLARTAGTSFMMTPYVVTRYYRAPEVILGMGYKENVDIWSVGCIMGEMIKGGVLFPGTDHIDQWNKVIEQLGTPCPEFMKKLQPTVRTYVENRPKYAGYSFEKLFPDVLFPADSEHNKLKASQARDLLSKMLVIDASKRISVDEALQHPYINVWYDPSEAEAPPPKIPDKQLDEREHTIEEWKELIYKEVMDLEERTKNGVIRGQPSPLGAAVINGSQHPSSSSSVNDVSSMSTDPTLASDTDSSLEAAAGPLGCCR","Homo sapiens","","Tchem","Kinase","2.539586","2.880179","2.072891","2.625262","2.420215","2.152895","3.044501","3.046982","2.992523","3.148298","2.842915","3.014486","4.785322","2.652601","2.057635","2.719809","2.709799","2.50254","2.584066","1.810477"

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42. Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)- dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B- ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF- kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF- kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O- tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity.

Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2- induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MSTASAASSSSSSSAGEMIEAPSQVLNFEEIDYKEIEVEEVVGRGAFGVVCKAKWRAKDVAIKQIESESERKAFIVELRQLSRVNHPNIVKLYGACLNPVCLVMEYAEGGSLYNVLHGAEPLPYYTAAHAMSWCLQCSQGVAYLHSMQPKALIHRDLKPPNLLLVAGGTVLKICDFGTACDIQTHMTNNKGSAAWMAPEVFEGSNYSEKCDVFSWGIILWEVITRRKPFDEIGGPAFRIMWAVHNGTRPPLIKNLPKPIESLMTRCWSKDPSQRPSMEEIVKIMTHLMRYFPGADEPLQYPCQYSDEGQSNSATSTGSFMDIASTNTSNKSDTNMEQVPATNDTIKRLESKLLKNQAKQQSESGRLSLGASRGSSVESLPPTSEGKRMSADMSEIEARIAATTAYSKPKRGHRKTASFGNILDVPEIVISGNGQPRRRSIQDLTVTGTEPGQVSSRSSSPSVRMITTSGPTSEKPTRSHPWTPDDSTDTNGSDNSIPMAYLTLDHQLQPLAPCPNSKESMAVFEQHCKMAQEYMKVQTEIALLLQRKQELVAELDQDEKDQQNTSRLVQEHKKLLDENKSLSTYYQQCKKQLEVIRSQQQKRQGTS","Homo sapiens","","Tchem","Kinase","1.650399","4.497202","1.616147","2.104522","1.496847","1.033424","2.496365","2.436295","2.784485","4.477505","4.517372","2.45198","4.46753","1.803262","1.501589","2.340577","2.496254","2.023666","1.719012","1.030735"

In addition, functions during the early stages of wound repair to stabilize the lesion and guide cell migration during re- epithelialization. Was originally thought to be essential for platelet aggregation, based on in vitro studies using anticoagulated blood.

MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma- radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration.","label: attribute=""display name"" labelsize=12 labelAlignment=left outline=true outlineColor=white outlineTransparency=95 outlineWidth=10 background=false color=black dropShadow=false","","stringdb","protein","MSSPPPARSGFYRQEVTKTAWEVRAVYRDLQPVGSGAYGAVCSAVDGRTGAKVAIKKLYRPFQSELFAKRAYRELRLLKHMRHENVIGLLDVFTPDETLDDFTDFYLVMPFMGTDLGKLMKHEKLGEDRIQFLVYQMLKGLRYIHAAGIIHRDLKPGNLAVNEDCELKILDFGLARQADSEMTGYVVTRWYRAPEVILNWMRYTQTVDIWSVGCIMAEMITGKTLFKGSDHLDQLKEIMKVTGTPPAEFVQRLQSDEAKNYMKGLPELEKKDFASILTNASPLAVNLLEKMLVLDAEQRVTAGEALAHPYFESLHDTEDEPQVQKYDDSFDDVDRTLDEWKRVTYKEVLSFKPPRQLGARVSKETPL","Homo sapiens","1CM8|4QUM","Tchem","Kinase","1.780222","2.923839","1.314414","1.232171","1.218924","1.209234","4.45513","2.022356","2.15662","1.85118","1.734105","4.636072","3.882662","4.391929","0.403078","1.521771","1.610103","1.001482","1.311614","0.649984"
